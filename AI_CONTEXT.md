## 1. What this repo is

The **strategy execution engine** — a small Python package (`trading_strategy_engine`)
that the backend **imports in-process** (not a deployed service). It runs a
strategy, records a run, and reports status, persisting to the same filesystem
strategy store the backend uses.

- **Install:** `pip install -e .` (or pinned via the backend's `requirements.txt`)
- **Public API:** `from trading_strategy_engine import run_strategy, get_status`
- **Note:** the `README.md` still describes the old `src/{strategies,execution,risk}`
  scaffold; the real package is `trading_strategy_engine/`.

## 2. Branches & environments

| Env | Branch | Deployed? |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| Production | `main` | No — library, pip-installed by backend |
| Staging | `staging` | No |
| Dev | `dev` | No |

There are no deploy workflows: this is a package, not a running service. It ships
by being a dependency of the backend image — the backend pins it in its
`requirements.txt` as `git+https://github.com/zmz-commits/trading-strategy-engine@main`,
so **merging to `main` is the release**.

The one workflow that publishes anything is `build-sandbox.yml`
(`Dockerfile.sandbox` → `ghcr.io/zmz-commits/trading-strategy-sandbox:prod`),
which the platform's compose `sandbox` service consumes. The root `Dockerfile`
is referenced by no workflow and builds an image nothing pulls; it is useful only
for running the engine standalone by hand.

## 3. Functions & modules (what the code does)

### `trading_strategy_engine/__init__.py`
- Re-exports `run_strategy`, `get_status`.

### `trading_strategy_engine/runner.py`
- `run_strategy(strategy_id, config, store_path)` → `RunResult`. Finds the
  strategy dir, creates `runs/`, writes a `running` draft, then a `completed`
  `RunResult` with one initialization `Transaction`; updates the strategy's
  `lastRunAt`/`lastRunStatus`/`transactions` in `strategy.json`.
  **Currently a stub** — it records a run lifecycle but contains no real trading
  logic yet (the place to add signals/orders/backtests).
- `get_status(strategy_id, store_path)` → latest `RunResult` (newest file in
  `runs/`), else an `idle` result.
- `_find_strategy_dir` — locates the strategy dir by id within the store.

### `trading_strategy_engine/models.py`
- `Transaction` (signal/order/error), `RunResult` (run_id, state, timestamps,
  transactions, notifications), `RunConfig`. `StrategyStatus` =
  `idle|running|completed|error`.

### `trading_strategy_engine/strategies/base.py`
- `BaseStrategy(ABC)` with abstract `run(config) -> RunResult` — the extension
  point for concrete strategies.

### `tsp/` — authoring SDK (Phase 1b, custom-indicator IDE)
- Separate top-level package (NOT imported by `trading_strategy_engine/__init__`,
  so it can't affect the backend). Pip-installable into the JupyterLab kernel.
- `tsp.Ctx` — execution context: exposes OHLCV Series (`open/high/low/close/volume`),
  `param(name, default)`, built-in indicator helpers, and `plot(name, series, kind)`.
- `tsp.indicators` — `sma/ema/rsi/macd/bbands/vwap/stoch` (same math as the backend).
- `tsp.run_indicator(compute, bars, params)` — runs a user `compute(ctx)` and returns
  `{indicators: {name: {kind, time, values}}}` (what the sandbox worker calls).
- `tsp.publish(name, compute, kind, ...)` — writes `compute.py` + `meta.json` to a
  registry (`$TSP_REGISTRY`). Auth-gating lives in the backend/UI, not here.
- See platform `docs/ROADMAP.md` §5.

---

## 4. Features
- Pydantic run/transaction models shared in shape with the backend.
- Filesystem run persistence compatible with the backend's strategy store.
- Abstract base class for pluggable strategies.
- **`tsp` authoring SDK** — the indicator `compute(ctx)` contract + built-in
  indicator math + publish-to-registry (Phase 1b of the custom-indicator IDE).
- **Gap:** no concrete strategy implementations or real execution/risk logic yet;
  sandbox worker + registry consumption + chart wiring still to come.

## 5. Latest Changes (Living)
> Prepend newest first. Recompute: `git log origin/main --no-merges --oneline`.

- **2026-11-07** (`dev`) — remove the three Hetzner `deploy-{dev,staging,prod}.yml`
  workflows. They were added before the engine settled into a library and never
  succeeded once (0/6 runs since June): the repo has no `SSH_HOST`/`SSH_KEY`
  secrets, and no `engine-*` service exists in the platform's compose file.
- **2026-06-21** (`feature/tsp-sdk` → `dev`) — add `tsp` authoring SDK (Ctx,
  indicator math, run_indicator, publish) — Phase 1b of the custom-indicator IDE.
- **2026-06-11** (`main`) — add GHCR docker login to VM deploy step.
- **2026-06-10** (`main`) — add Dockerfile + 3-env GitHub Actions CI/CD (Hetzner).
- **2026-06-09** (`main`) — 3-tier branching docs.
- **2026-05-24** (`main`) — implement engine package: models, runner, base strategy.

## 6. What's next / TODO
- **Phase 1b cont.:** sandbox worker that loads a registry entry + live bars and
  calls `tsp.run_indicator`; backend endpoint to serve custom indicators; UI wiring
  to render them on the chart.
- Strategy side of the SDK (`on_bar(ctx)`, `buy/sell/position`, metrics).
- Implement real strategy logic behind `BaseStrategy`; wire into `runner.run_strategy`.
- See platform `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the full phased plan.
